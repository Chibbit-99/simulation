# Simulation

***Simulation*** is a game where you try to escape a supposed simulation, and every so often an (*in game*) update or patch will roll out, adding new features. Often you will encounter glitches, which the "**Developer**" doesn't want you to know, and will often patch the glitch seconds after you discover it. Throughout the game you must locate the time machines, which can take you to previous or future versions. You must find the versions that have glitches and exploit them in the hope to break the simulation and escape.
